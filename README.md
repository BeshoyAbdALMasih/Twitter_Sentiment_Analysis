# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

A notebook-based Twitter sentiment analysis project using the Sentiment140 dataset.  
The project vectorizes tweets with **TF-IDF** and trains classic classifiers (`BernoulliNB`, `LogisticRegression`, `LinearSVC`) to predict tweet sentiment (positive / negative). This repository contains the notebook `Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb` that walks through data download, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and simple experimentation.

## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a classical machine-learning approach to sentiment analysis on Twitter data:

- Download the Sentiment140 dataset (1.6M tweets).
- Basic preprocessing (lowercasing; optional cleaning).
- Convert text to TF-IDF vectors using `sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer`.
- Train and evaluate multiple classifiers: `BernoulliNB`, `LogisticRegression`, `LinearSVC`.
- Compare performance using accuracy and classification reports.

The work is notebook-first to make the pipeline easy to read and modify.

## Dataset

**Sentiment140** (a.k.a. `kazanova/sentiment140`) â€” ~1.6 million labeled tweets with polarity (0 = negative, 4 = positive).  
The notebook downloads the dataset using `kagglehub` by default (see notebook cell). You can also download manually via Kaggle CLI and update the path in the notebook.

Important: the dataset is large. Working with the full dataset requires sufficient RAM and time. Consider sampling for quick experiments.
